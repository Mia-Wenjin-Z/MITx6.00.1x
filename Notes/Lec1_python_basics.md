## Computer programming Basics

**A stored program** computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.



**A fixed program computer** is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.



**A program counter** points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.



**6 primitive operations by Turing** : left, right, scan, read, stop

## Python Basics



* Objects

  * All objects are stored in heap
  * Scalars
    * int
    * float
    * bool - True / False
    * NoneType - None
  * Non-scalars

* Operators

  * ```text
    level 1
    ** power
    
    level 2
    *
    / - result is float
    // - int division, quotient
    % - remainder 
    
    注意，python的// 和 % 是取模，商向负无穷方向舍入(floor()函数)
     eg. -7 // 4 = -2， -7 % 4 = 1
    
    level 3
    + 
    -
    ```

* Assignment : `=`

* Comparison

  ```
  1. values
  > / >=
  < / <= 
  ==
  !=
  
  2. boolean 
  
  not
  and 
  or
  ```

* Conditional

```
if else
if elif
if elif else
```
